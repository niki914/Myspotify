# Myspotify

An Apple Music-like third-party Spotify player (currently for Android only).

[Click to download the installation package](https://github.com/niki914/Myspotify/releases/latest)

# How It Works

This is not a local player; it needs to be used with the official Spotify app. You can think of it as a remote control.

See the introduction video on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kspFz1Eom/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=e928ac8df37862d7e05a1286cc6b1329)

# ⚠️ Usage Restrictions

This app is **limited to accounts that have been added by the developer (a Premium membership is required)**. Otherwise, you won't be able to connect to Spotify. So, if you want to try it out, you'll need to **contact me and provide your username and email address**, and I will add you. This is a restriction imposed by Spotify's official policy.

If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please feel free to submit an issue or contact me through other channels\!

# Regarding Open Source

It is not open source at the moment but will be considered for the future.

# TODO

  - If the number of users exceeds the limit of 25, I will provide a new way to use the app.
